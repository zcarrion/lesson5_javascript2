### Project Description:
In this assignment a new workspace was setup in Cloud9 and a new repository on GitHub was created as well to work on a Tax Calculator application.  The getElementById() method was used to reference elements from the html document pointing at the id value, in order to input data. The code for each type of filer tax bracket was created. Also a clear calculator button was created.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Conditional statements to make decisions:  The “if” statement evaluates a condition. If the condition evaluates to “true”, any statements in the subsequent code block are executed.  Another statement is the if/else statements; as the if statement checks a condition that resolves to “true” the first code block is executed, but if not, then the second code (under else) is run instead.  Arrays are a set of data represented by a single variable. An array can be created with or without a value. 
2. Comparison operators are used to compare two operands. Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.  There are three types of loop: for, while, and do/while.  Each repeats a set of statements.  Loops check a condition. If it returns “true”, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns “true”, the code block will run again.  It repeats until the condition returns “false”.  
3. Functions: a related group of statements together to perform a specific task.  If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). They are not associated with an object, and contained within a script element. Is considered a variable in JavaScript.  There are two types: named function and anonymous functions.  To executed the function, it must be called (invoked). Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value. getElementByTagName()[] reference to a web page element on the similar tag type.
